# Building Images

Before we get into building images, we need to discuss the magical fairy land from which they came, the *Docker Hub*.  Go ahead and create a Docker Hub account if you don't already have one, as we are going to build some images and push them to our Ducker Hubs.

Every image you attempt to run that isn't available locally is downloaded from a registry. Images published to a registry must be named like
> \<repository\_name\>/\<name\>:\<tag\>
